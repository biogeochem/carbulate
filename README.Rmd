# carbulate

This package will calculate the carbonate species (CO2(aq), HCO3-, CO3--) concentrations from a measured DIC concentration, pH value, and temperature of your water sample. Values will be added onto the dataframe 'df' you supply.

## Parameters
carbulate(df, 'DIC_col_mg.L', 'pH_col', 'temp_col_C', 'pressure_kPa')

df - your dataframe that contains all the variables  
DIC_col_mg.L - Name of the column that contains the measured dissolved inorganic carbon concentration (mg C/L)  
pH_col - Name of column with your measured pH  
temp_col_C - Name of column with your measured water temperature (in Celsius)  
pressure_kPa - Name of column with the atmospheric pressure where the sample was collected from (in kPa)  

## Example
This is how you would input this function to add the carbonate species to the dataframe 'water.df':  
water.df <- carbulate(water.df, 'DIC_mgC.L', 'pH', 'Temp_C')
